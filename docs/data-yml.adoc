= Input file format

:toc:

tileigi uses the tm2source yml file format. The filename can be whatever you
want. It must be a link:http://yaml.org/[YAML file]. Only the first document in
a file is used, and it must be a mapping (a.k.a. hash, dictionary)

== Top level

The following keys must be present at the top level.

`minzoom`:: The global minimum zoom.
`maxzoom`:: The global maximum zoom.
`Layer`:: Sequence (list) of all the layers.

== Layer

Each layer corresponds to one layer in the vector tile.

Every Layer must have a `Datasource` key which controls where the data comes from.

=== `properties`

An optional mapping/dict for this layer.

`minzoom`:: Minimum (i.e. first) zoom level for this layer. This layer will not be generated for zoom levels less than this. If omitted, the global minzoom is used.
`maxzoom`:: Maximum (i.e. last) zoom level for this layer. This layer will not be generated for zoom levels greater than this. If omitted, the global maxzoo is used.
`buffer-size`:: Buffer of geometry for this layer in whole number of 'pixels' (where one tile is 256 'pixels' wide & high). How much outside the border of this tile to take and to cut.

=== Datasource

`dbname`:: Database name
`table`:: PostgreSQL table to read data from. You can use a select query to do
advanced querying, but it must be in 'table form' (e.g. `(select * from
mypoints where shop='yes') as t`). It must return a column called `way` of type
geometry. It doesn't check the SRID, but tileigi only works with Google
Mercator.

Currently it only connects to the postgresql server on localhost, and using the current unix user.

All columns returned from the `table` are used as attributes for the vector
tile object. The following PostgreSQL types are converted to a Vector Tile
Number type: `float4`, `float8`, `int4`, `int8`, `numeric`.  The following
PostgreSQL types are converted to a Vector Tile String type: `text`, `varchar`.


==== Available text substitions

Within the `table` option the following text substitions are made:

`!pixel_width!`/`!pixel_height!`:: Width/Height of one pixel, in units of the spherical mercator projection. This can be used to filter object that correspond to more than X pixels in an image (presuming a 256Ã—256 image)
`!scale_denominator!`:: Taken from mapnik and can allow filtering based on zoom level.
`!bbox!`:: The bounding box of the tile. This will always be added to the query, but this could allow more fine grained control. Unlike mapnik, if you use this substitution, tileigi will still add a bbox filter later.
