= tileigi: Let us Tile!

tileigi generates vector tiles from a postgres database.

The input format is the `.tm2source` YAML file format. 

== Installation

    cargo build --release

`release` mode is much faster than the default `debug` mode.

== Example usage

Sample command:

    tileigi --data-yml ./myfile-data.yml  --dest-mbtiles ./mytiles.mbtiles

It is still in early days, and barely beta qualtiy, and the dependencies can be funny.
